The code follows the 5 steps as indicated in the description of the work project.

The main functions used to solve the questions are:
1) “rbind” which allows to merge 2 sets of data by rows 
2) “grepl” : it is used in the framework of regular expression to look up for names in features that contain “mean” or “std”. “which” is then used to filter and select only those names.
3) There are no specific functions used. The purpose is to add a column named “activity” which containing names of activity that do correspond to the label using numbers.
4) setting column name for subject_data and merging all data
5) apply a function (“mean”) then combine results into a new data frame is achieved using “ddply”. Finally, data are saved into a new data frame using “write.table”.

Variables:
“x_test”, “x_train”, “y_test”, “y_train”, “subject_test” and “subject_train” contain the data from the downloaded files
“x_data”, “y_data” and “subject_data” are merged data from pairs of data corresponding to “test” and “train”.
The names of “x_data” is not correct that is why we need to use “features”. “logic_features_mean_std” is first generated and it is a logical vector that contains all matching pattern to either “mean” or “std”. The  “which” is used to extract “features_mean_std” which is a vector containing the indices of the “TRUE” values of “logic_features_mean_std”.
“complete_data” comes from the merging of “x_data”, “y_data” and “subject_data”
“dataframe_avg_data” si the new dataframe generated from “mean” function applied to each subject and activity using “ddply” from “dplyr” package. Finally, "dataframe_avg_data.txt" is the file where is saved this new data frame.
